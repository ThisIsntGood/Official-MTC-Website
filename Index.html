    <h3>ThisIsntGood, also called Malik Dorleans, is a moderately skilled digital artist and/or animator who has been drawing since early December of 2023. He is the first member of MTC.
        <p>
            He has started his career of drawing by making some sketches in his algebra notebook, sketches of an overly simply designed character that would represent him, an OC if you will, who eventually was named Disim. Since then he has been making new characters, representing a different part of him, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>How much of a goof he may be at times</li>
                <li>How much he enjoys technology</li>
                <li>How much talent he has with art</li>
                <li>How much he loves axolotls</li>
                <li>How much kindness he can be for others around him</li>
                <li>How much malice he can have for little to no reason</li>
                <li>How loud or how much he talks</li>
                <li>How much energy gets depleted without warning</li>
                <li>How much energy he gets out of nowhere</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            He had no idea what to do with these characters until the second half of his school year, where he met MrScriptDev and CocoCrawl. He found out that MrScriptDev was pretty great at coding, and that CocoCrawl was also great at coding, thus they decided to make a game, a 2D platformer in the land of Squitanica, taking place in ThisIsntGood's mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the game you would play as a character named Disim, who is traversing island to island to find his friends, who have each been captured by wizards, who are nothing but diabolically evil. These Wizards consist of:
            <ul>
                <li>Newbie Wizard</li>
                <li>Flying Wizard</li>
                <li>Flame Wizard</li>
                <li>Zapper Wizard</li>
                <li>Copper Wizard</li>
                <li>Silver Wizard</li>
                <li>Gold Wizard</li>
                <li>Emerald Wizard (Heals other wizards as it runs away)</li>
                <li>Pow Wizard</li>
                <li>Mini Wizard</li>
                <li>Slime Wizard (Secret Boss)</li>
                <li>Light Wizard</li>
                <li>Aqua-Wizard</li>
                <li>Jester Wizard</li>
                <li>Shadow Wizard</li>
                <li>Armory Wizard</li>
                <li>Rainbow Wizard</li>
                <li>Fishing Wizard</li>
                <li>Cat Wizard</li>
                <li>Siren Wizard</li>
                <li>Molten Wizard</li>
                <li>Construction Wizard</li>
                <li>4th Wall Wizard</li>
                <li>Yin-n'-Yang Wizard</li>
                <li>Knight Wizard</li>
                <li>Chef Wizard</li>
                <li>Shattered Wizard</li>
                <li>Skelly Wizard</li>
                <li>Master Wizard</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            There's one wizard named Wizella, but she's chill.
        </p>

    <h2>ThisIsntGood</h2>
    <a href=""></a><img src="assets/ThisIsntGood Logo.svg">
    <h3>ThisIsntGood, also called Malik Dorleans, is a moderately skilled digital artist and/or animator who has been
        drawing since early December of 2023. He is the first member of MTC.
        <p>
            He has started his career of drawing by making some sketches in his algebra notebook, sketches of an overly
            simply designed character that would represent him, an OC if you will, who eventually was named Disim. Since
            then he has been making new characters, representing a different part of him.
        </p>
        <p>
            He had no idea what to do with these characters until the second half of his school year, where he met
            MrScriptDev and CocoCrawl. He found out that MrScriptDev was pretty great at coding, and that CocoCrawl was
            also great at coding, thus they decided to make a game, a 2D platformer in the land of Squitanica, taking
            place in ThisIsntGood's mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the game you would play as a character named Disim, who is traversing island to island to find his
            friends, who have each been captured by wizards, who are nothing but diabolically evil.

        </p>

    <h3>MrScriptDev, otherwise known as Davis Hawkins, is a professional coder since 2022. He is the second member of
        MTC.
        <p>
            He has made projects by making designs on scratch and putting them on coding applications such as Godot or
            Visual Studio Code.
        </p>
        <p>
            His projects would consist of...
        <ul>
            <li>Zombos, a game where you play as a survivor and there are a TON of zombies, a.k.a Zombos. You have to
                either run or fight against the Zombos with the tools necessary.</li>
            <li>Crazy Bus, a game where you play as a bus driver that has to pick up kids and drop them off to their
                school, and you can customize your bus too!</li>
            <li>Fire-Copter, a game where you have to control a helicopter that sprays water in order to destroy the
                fires occupying the buildings.</li>
        </ul>
